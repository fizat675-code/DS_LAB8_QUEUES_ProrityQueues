# DS_LAB8_QUEUES_ProrityQueues
This lab focused on implementing Queues and Priority Queues in Python using deque and heapq. Through examples like bank and chatbot simulations, we learned how FIFO ensures fairness while priority queues handle urgent tasks first, showing their practical use in real-life service systems.
